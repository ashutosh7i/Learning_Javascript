<!--
    javascript works with following line by line instructions like any programming language
    these instructions are called statements.

    In javascript the instructions are made up of
    Values,
    Operators,
    Expressions,
    Keywords,
    Comments 

    for ex- document.getElementBYId("demo").innerHTML = "hello";
    this statement in js tells browser that
    in the html document, get element named demo by using name as element id in page,
    then write its inner html as "hello".

    Statements are executed one by one , this is javascript code.

    use Semicolon for end of statement.
    eg-
    let a = 10;
    or let a = 10, b = 20, c = 30;etc;

    Javascript ignores whitespaces, but use them to make code look good.
    like use in operators and equations to make it look good an easier to read.

    Javascript has use of keywords, some of them are-
    var,let,const,if,switch,for,function,return,try etc.

    ----------------------
    Js Basics-
    values= literals & Variables.

    Literals- Have fixed values
    written as , for numbers- 10 , 10.0
    for variables- "this" or like 'this'

    Variables - to store data and change it.
    in js there are 3 types of varibles

    var, lets and const, syntax=
    var_type varName = value;

    assignment operator to assign (=)
    arithmetic operator for computation (+-*/)

    js comments are made using // or /* */

    in js camelCase is preffered,
    first letter small, then second word first letter capital, like,
    ironMan,captainAmerica, etc.
